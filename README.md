# Repository of Material for the 6th i-CoMSE Workshop: Methods for Advanced Sampling

### 6th iCoMSE workshop: Enhanced Sampling Virtual School 2024

### Dates: Feb 12-16, 2024

This workshop is supported by funding from National Science Foundation Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure

**Description:** This workshop will provide an overview of modern enhanced sampling algorithms, including replica exchange, umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and path sampling methods. It will feature of mix of lectures and hands-on exercises running GROMACS on national supercomputing resources, and will run for 3 hours each day. The workshop will include a session on diversity, equity, and inclusion aspects of computational sciences. The session will run for five days, 3-6 EDT / 2-5 CDT / 1-4 MDT / 12-3 PDT. Note that the workshop will be similar (though not exactly the same) as last yearsâ€™ workshop, whose material is posted here for reference: https://github.com/icomse/3rd_workshop_advanced_sampling
